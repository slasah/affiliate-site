Having started in February 2012 it would be fair to say that Bookmaker.com.au is relatively new. The service is licensed and regulated by the Norfolk Island Gaming Authority. Bookmakers head offices are located in Brisbane. 

Bookmaker.com.au was acquired by the UK gaming giant Ladbrokes plc. 

In September 2013 as part of their expansion into Australia. Bookmaker.com.au and Ladbrokes plc. operate using the same markets and odds, but with different templates and sign up promotions.
